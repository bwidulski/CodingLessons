# Conditionals

### What are Conditionals?

Conditionals decide the path that code takes based off a statement's truthfullness. They are used when the programmer is unsure exactly what the value of something will be and they must route their code accordingly.

There are a few different types, but we'll first start with ```if statements```

### Keywords

All programming languages have something called ```keywords``` - Operators that are reserved for use by the programming language, and can not be used in any other context. The three keywords related to if statements are ```if```, ```elif```, and ```else```. 

This means it would be invalid in Python to do something like:

```commandline
if = else
```

### If Statements

The three parts of Python's if statements are:

- ```if```: The first part of the if statement. It is entirely necessary in any if statement to use this. If it's statement is evaluated to equal ```True```, then it will execute the code below it. If it evaluates to ```False```, then the next block of code will be executed
- ```elif```: This will be used in the case that there is another specific statement to be evaluated and is not necessary in an if statement. It behaves the same way as if.
- ```else```: This will be executed in the case that all other statements evaluate to ```False```. It can be used as a catch-all for anythign that falls outside the expected scope of conditional outcomes.

As an example:

```python
