# Conditionals

### What are Conditionals?

Conditionals decide the path that code takes based off a statement's truthfullness. They are used when the programmer is unsure exactly what the value of something will be and they must route their code accordingly.

There are a few different types, including ```if statements```, ```switch```, and ```ternary operators``` among others.
