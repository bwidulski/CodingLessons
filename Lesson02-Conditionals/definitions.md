### Keywords

All programming languages have something called ```keywords``` - Operators that are reserved for use by the programming language, and can not be used in any other context. The three keywords related to if statements are ```if```, ```elif```, and ```else```. 

This means it would be invalid in Python to do something like:

```commandline
if = else
```
